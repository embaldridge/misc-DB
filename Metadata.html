INTRODUCTION

<p>This dataset was developed to provide a source of abundance data for groups that do not have extensive compilations of abundance data to address some of the gaps in the available macroecological datasets. </p> 

 
<p>There are several caveats to the use of this database.  Abundance has been recorded as the raw abundance or the relative abundance, depending on what was available from the original source.  Abundance is the total number of individuals captured, relative abundance is the total number of individuals captured for a single species/ total number of individuals of all species.  Zeros are present in the data for some sites; this should be taken into account when using the data.  Some species are incompletely identified, 
these were identified as closely as possible per the original source, but there may be more than one unidentified species in a given genus.  In one source, hybrid individuals were clearly identified, these were indicated by a capital X added to the end of the specific epithet (Genus speciesX). </p>

<section>
<p>A. Overall project description</p>

     

    <p> Identity:</p>

<p>Understanding drivers of species abundance.</p> 

 

     <p>Originators:</p>

<p>Elita Baldridge</p>

 

 

    <p> Period of study:</p>

<p>2010 - 2012</p>

 

     <p>Objectives:

<p>To compile information on community abundance for vertebrate and invertebrate groups for which there were not already compiled abundance databases.</p>

 

     <p>Abstract:

<p>Same as above.  This database is not a subset of a larger study.</p>

 

     <p>Source(s) of funding:</p>

<p>E. B. has been supported by Utah State University.</p>

<section>
<p>B. Specific subproject description</p>

 

     <p>Site description:</p>

<p>Sources contained data collected from a variety of different locations, resulting in a data set with a global extent.</p>

 

     <p>Experimental or sampling design:</p>

<p>Data were obtained from the scientific literature. </p>

 

     <p>Research Methods:</p>

     <p>Field/Laboratory:</p>

<p>Not applicable</p>

 

    <p> Data Sources:</p>

<p>Data were compiled from the scientific literature.  References for data sources are presented in a separate file, citations_table_abundances.csv, because of the extensive reference list involved with this project.</p> 

 

    <p> Data Collection</p>

<p>Data were hand entered into a raw data file as they came from the original source or extracted from the original source computationally.  All the data papers initially downloaded were not included in the final summary, because they were not deemed suitable for inclusion in the final database.</p>

<p>The data have not been updated taxonomically; the species names were kept as given in the original source.  </p>

 

    <p> Variables:</p>

<p>Abundance: total number of individuals captured</p>

<p>Relative_abundance: total number of individuals captured for a single species/ total number of individuals of all species.</p>
